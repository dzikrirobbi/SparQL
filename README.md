SPARQL is a query language used to retrieve data stored as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and it is standardized by the W3C. 

General query of SPARQL :

PREFIX (Namespace Prefixes)
SELECT (Result Set)
FROM dan FROM NAMED (Dataset)
WHERE (Query Triple Pattern)
ORDER BY, DISTINCT, HAVING, LIMIT (Modifiers)

In This Repo, I create SPARQL Example with Python (RDFLib)
